# Hot Button on Fire Deluxe
A JavaFX shooting game. The game features different types of game modes (and difficulty levels) which can be unlocked by achieving a good score:
 * Hunt - button appear for a few seconds & you have to shoot them
 * Time - shoot as many buttons as possible in one minute
 * Click - shoot 60 buttons (as quickly as possible)
 * Horror - like hunt, but with a shocking surprise

Every game mode does have its own high score, which is encrypted with AES encryption.
